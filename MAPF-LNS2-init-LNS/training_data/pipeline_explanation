Step 1:
    Creating files with 60 requests without time from the database in our format.
    The files are saved in directory: initial_requests_without_time.

Step 2:
    Using the files in directory initial_requests_without_time to create files with the same requests in the lns format.
    The files are saved in directory: custom_lns_requests.

Step 3:
    Using the files in directory custom_lns_requests as inputs to the lns code and saving the output files.
    The files are saved in directory: custom_lns_outputs.

Step 4:
    Using the files in directory custom_lns_outputs to create files with k=30 paths that form a solution in our format.
    The files are saved in directory: training_paths_files.

Step 5:
    Using the files in directory training_paths_files to create files with the requests for each solution in our format.
    The files are saved in directory: training_requests_files.

summary pipeline:
    initial_requests_without_time -> custom_lns_requests -> custom_lns_outputs ->
    -> training_paths_files -> training_requests_files
